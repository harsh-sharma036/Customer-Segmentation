# Customer-Segmentation

We will be using E-commerce dataset of user purchases and try develop a model that allow us to do two things:

1. Classifying customers into segments.
2. Anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase by assigning them appropriate cluster/segment
